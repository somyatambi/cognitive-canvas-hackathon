# 🔧 CRITICAL META LLAMA FIXES APPLIED

## 🚨 Issue Found: Two Agents Using Wrong Model

**Discovery:** During prize eligibility analysis, found that **2 out of 5 agents** were using `openai/gpt-oss-120b` instead of Meta Llama 3.3 70B.

**Impact:**
- ❌ **Before Fix**: Only 3 out of 5 agents used Meta Llama (60% usage)
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Could be disqualified from Meta Llama prize for insufficient usage
- 📉 **Score Impact**: Meta Llama prize score was 60/100 instead of 95/100

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### **Fix #1: Critic Agent** 🔧

**File:** `critic-agent/main.py` (line 45)

**Before:**
```python
model = "openai/gpt-oss-120b"  # ❌ Wrong model!
```

**After:**
```python
model = "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"  # ✅ Using Meta Llama 3.3 70B for analytical critique
```

**Why this matters:**
- Critic agent needs deep analytical thinking
- Meta Llama 3.3 70B (70 billion parameters) provides superior analysis
- Now properly utilizing Meta's flagship open-source model

---

### **Fix #2: Roadmap Agent** 🔧

**File:** `roadmap-agent/main.py` (line 45)

**Before:**
```python
model = "openai/gpt-oss-120b"  # ❌ Wrong model!
```

**After:**
```python
model = "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"  # ✅ Using Meta Llama 3.3 70B for strategic planning
```

**Why this matters:**
- Roadmap creation requires long-term strategic thinking
- Meta Llama 3.3 70B excels at planning and reasoning
- Demonstrates proper model selection for complex tasks

## 🚀 Next Steps (To Test)

### **1. Rebuild Docker Containers** (Required)

The agents need to be rebuilt to use the new model configuration:

```bash
# Stop current containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild with new model config
docker-compose up --build -d

# Verify all containers running
docker ps
```

### **2. Test Each Agent**

**Test Critic Agent (CRITICAL - was broken):**
```
1. Generate 3 ideas with Brainstormer
2. Click "Get Critique" on any idea
3. Verify response appears (not error)
4. Check it provides strengths, challenges, recommendation
```

**Test Roadmap Agent (CRITICAL - was broken):**
```
1. Select an idea
2. Click "Select & Expand Idea" → "Generate Roadmap"
3. Verify roadmap phases appear
4. Should see "Phase 1:", "Phase 2:", etc.
```

### **3. Verify Logs**

```bash
# Check critic agent using correct model
docker logs cognitive-canvas-backend-critic-agent-1

# Check roadmap agent using correct model
docker logs cognitive-canvas-backend-roadmap-agent-1

# Should see requests to OpenRouter (not errors)
```
