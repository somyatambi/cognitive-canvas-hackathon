## 🎯 Perfect Demo Flow (2 minutes)

### Minute 1: Setup & Brainstorm (0:00-1:00)

**Say:** "Starting a project is hard. Cognitive Canvas makes it easy."

**Do:**
1. Type prompt: `"AI-powered fitness app for busy professionals"`
2. Click "Brainstorm Ideas"
3. **Wait for 3 ideas to stream in** (Meta Llama 3.3 70B)
4. **Point out:** "Three focused ideas, powered by Meta Llama"

### Minute 2: Expand & Execute (1:00-2:00)

**Say:** "Let's develop idea #2 into a full plan."

**Do:**
1. Right-click idea #2 → "Select & Expand Idea"
2. **Show critique appearing** (strengths/challenges)
3. Right-click critique → "Create Roadmap"
4. **Show vertical roadmap phases**
5. Right-click Phase 1 → "Break Down Tasks"
6. **EMPHASIZE:** "Tasks appear instantly - Cerebras AI is 20x faster!"
7. **Show task cards** with categories and time estimates

**Closing:**
- Scroll to bottom → **Point to sponsor badges**
- "Built with Meta Llama, Cerebras, and Docker"
- Show final canvas with all connected nodes

## 🏆 Sponsor Tech Highlights

### When to mention Meta Llama
- ✅ When ideas appear: "Powered by Meta Llama 3.3 70B"
- ✅ During critique: "Llama provides nuanced, balanced feedback"
- ✅ Total usage: "3 out of 4 agents use Meta Llama"

### When to mention Cerebras
- ✅ When tasks appear: "Cerebras generates these in 200 milliseconds!"
- ✅ Speed comparison: "20x faster than GPU-based inference"
- ✅ Strategy: "Right model for the task - Cerebras for structured output"

### When to mention Docker
- ✅ Architecture: "4 microservices orchestrated by Docker MCP Gateway"
- ✅ Deployment: "One command: docker-compose up"
- ✅ Production: "Production-ready architecture, not just a prototype"

## 🎨 Visual Elements to Show

### Must Show:
1. ✅ Sponsor badge footer (bottom of screen)
2. ✅ Ideas streaming in real-time (not instant)
3. ✅ Multiple connected nodes on canvas
4. ✅ Task cards with color categories
5. ✅ Context menu (right-click)

### Nice to Have:
- Professional gradient design
- Node animations (fadeIn)
- Loading overlay with spinner
- App header with branding

---

## ⚡ Common Demo Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't:
- Start demo without pre-testing
- Type a super long prompt (keep it 5-10 words)
- Click too fast (let AI finish streaming)
- Forget to show sponsor badges
- Go over 2 minutes

### ✅ Do:
- Have a backup prompt ready
- Let streaming finish before next action
- Point to sponsor tech explicitly
- Show the full workflow (brainstorm → tasks)
- Practice at least 3 times before recording

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If ideas don't appear:
1. Check docker-compose logs: `docker-compose logs brainstormer-agent`
2. Verify OPENROUTER_API_KEY in .env
3. Check browser console for errors

### If tasks are slow:
1. Verify CEREBRAS_API_KEY is set
2. Check task-agent logs: `docker-compose logs task-agent`
3. Should see "cerebras.ai" in logs

### If frontend won't start:
1. Delete node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules`
2. Reinstall: `npm install`
3. Clear cache: `npm run dev -- --force`

### If nodes overlap:
- Drag them to better positions
- Use auto-layout: right-click → "Auto Layout"

## 📊 Stats to Memorize

| Metric | Value | When to Use |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Agents | 4 specialized | "We use 4 AI agents working together" |
| Meta Llama | 3 out of 4 agents | "75% of our system uses Meta Llama" |
| Cerebras Speed | 20x faster | "Cerebras is 20x faster than GPU inference" |
| Task Gen Time | 200ms | "Tasks appear in 200 milliseconds" |
| Ideas Generated | Always 3 | "Exactly 3 focused ideas, every time" |
| Sponsor Tech | All 3 used | "We use Meta, Cerebras, AND Docker" |

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Cognitive Canvas solves the blank canvas problem - that overwhelming feeling when starting a new project. Instead of a chatbot, we built a visual workspace where 4 specialized AI agents collaborate with you. Meta Llama 3.3 70B brainstorms creative ideas, critiques them, and creates strategic roadmaps. Cerebras AI breaks down phases into actionable tasks 20x faster than traditional inference. All orchestrated through a Docker MCP Gateway for production-ready microservices. From blank canvas to executable plan in under 2 minutes."

---

## 🎯 Judge Questions & Answers

### "Why use multiple AI models?"
> "Different tasks need different strengths. Llama 3.3 70B excels at creative ideation, while Cerebras' 8B model optimized for speed is perfect for structured output. It's like having a creative director AND an execution specialist."

### "Why a canvas instead of chat?"
> "Brainstorming is spatial. You need to see ideas side-by-side, connect them, and build on them visually. Chat is linear and conversational - great for questions, not for ideation."

### "How is this production-ready?"
> "Docker MCP Gateway provides clean microservice isolation, horizontal scalability, and Nginx routing. We could deploy to Kubernetes tomorrow with minimal changes. Plus, multi-provider AI means no vendor lock-in."

### "What's the real-world use case?"
> "Entrepreneurs starting businesses, students beginning research projects, hackathon teams brainstorming ideas. Anyone who's stared at a blank page not knowing where to start. We give them structure and momentum."

### "What did you learn building this?"
> "Few-shot learning beats instructions for AI prompts. Streaming responses dramatically improve UX. Model selection matters - match the model to the task. Docker Compose is magic for multi-service development."
