## üöÄ Final Pre-Submission Steps

### Required Actions Before Submission:

1. **Test All Features** ‚úÖ
   ```bash
   # Start backend
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Start frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   
   # Test each feature:
   # - Brainstorm with all 3 personas (Student/Entrepreneur/Hackathon)
   # - Critique an idea
   # - Generate roadmap
   # - Break down tasks (verify time ranges and difficulty show up)
   # - Generate pitch deck and export PDF
   # - Save/load/edit/delete canvas
   ```

2. **Verify No Repetition in Brainstormer** ‚úÖ
   - Generate ideas 3-5 times
   - Confirm no repeated ideas (AI Mental Health Chatbot, GitHub Code Review, etc.)
   - Penalties at maximum (2.0/2.0) should prevent repetition

3. **Check API Keys are Working** ‚úÖ
   ```bash
   # Backend logs should show successful API calls
   docker-compose logs brainstormer-agent
   docker-compose logs task-agent
   ```

4. **Verify Task Estimates Display** ‚úÖ
   - Generate tasks from roadmap
   - Confirm each task shows:
     - Time range (e.g., "‚è±Ô∏è 2-4h")
     - Difficulty badge (Easy/Medium/Hard with color coding)

5. **Test Persona Modal** ‚úÖ
   - Right-click node ‚Üí "üß† Brainstorm Ideas"
   - Confirm modal appears with 3 persona cards
   - Test all 3 personas generate appropriate ideas

6. **Final Git Push** 
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Final submission: Cognitive Canvas with persona selection & enhanced task estimates"
   git push origin main
   ```

7. **Create Submission Video/Screenshots**
   - [ ] Screenshot of persona selection modal
   - [ ] Screenshot of task breakdown with time ranges and difficulty
   - [ ] Screenshot of full canvas workflow
   - [ ] Optional: Screen recording demo (2-3 minutes)
